> ### ⚠️ You need a Mac. That is the whole trick.
> Blip does **not** reimplement iMessage. Apple's protocol only runs on Apple
> hardware, so Blip uses a Mac you already own — any Mac signed into your
> Apple ID, awake and reachable over SSH — as the gateway. The Linux side is a
> thin client. **No Mac, no Blip.** When the Mac sleeps, Blip dims and waits.

## Blip 2.0

Version 2.0 (2026-08-31) is the "this is what I wanted" release. Since 1.0:

- **The app.** A Messages-style window — sidebar of every conversation,
  the open thread, compose — next to the bar popout. `SUPER+M`,
  double-click the bar icon, or `qs ipc … app`. Remembers size and whether
  it was open across shell restarts; title shows the unread count.
- **Contact photos** from the Mac's Contacts in the sidebar.
- **Contact-name resolver** for numbers/emails that appear on multiple cards:
  choose the right name for Blip, or open the matching source card on the Mac.
- **Link cards** with preview image, title, and host, like Messages.
- **Real-time push** — messages land in ~2 s via a watcher on the Mac.
- **Attachments both ways** — photos inline, files as chips, send by
  Ctrl+V / drag-and-drop / `/attach`, with captions; your own sent photos
  stay showable.
- **Search** across every message ever; **new conversation** from a
  contact search; **reply from a toast**; failed-delivery flags.
- **One source.** The Mac-side tools ship in this repo; `blip-setup`
  installs everything including a dedicated ssh key the Mac confines to
  the five bridge tools.
- **Audited.** A full security + privacy audit, every finding fixed or
  documented — [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md), [docs/PRIVACY.md](docs/PRIVACY.md).
  Message text never touches argv or disk on either machine.

Full history: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Why this exists

iMessage is macOS-only. Everyone who lives on Linux and owns an iPhone knows the
dance: pick up the phone, unlock it, type on glass, put it down, lose the
thread. BlueBubbles wants SIP off. AirMessage wants a server and a prayer.

Blip does something simpler. **The Mac you already own is the gateway.** It
holds `chat.db` and it can drive Messages.app with AppleScript. Everything else
is one multiplexed SSH socket and a bar widget that looks like it belongs.

No SIP disabled. No daemon on the Mac. No private API. No message cache on the
Linux side. If the Mac is asleep, the widget dims and says so.

## What you get

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

**In the bar**
- unread count across every thread
- dims with a slashed glyph when the Mac is unreachable
- left-click panel · **double-click opens the app window** · middle-click refresh · right-click mark all read

**Thread list**
- **pinned conversations from Messages.app**, in the same ordered avatar grid; Blip reads the Mac's pin state rather than maintaining a second favorites list
- contact photo (from the Mac's Contacts) or initials, name, preview, time
- **blue dot** that stays until you open *that* conversation — iMessage semantics, not "I glanced at the list"
- groups titled the way Messages.app titles them: the group's name, else its members

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

**Conversation**
- real bubbles — yours blue on the right, theirs grey on the left
- grouped into runs with one timestamp per run, day dividers, squared "tail" corner
- sender names above each run in a group
- **tapbacks** — ❤️👍😂 pills on the bubble corner, custom emoji included
- **"Read 4:42 PM"** under the last message of yours they've read (display only — Blip never sends receipts)
- **inline replies** quoted above the bubble · **Edited** tags · "unsent a message" tombstones
- **link cards** — URL messages show the preview image, title, and host, like Messages; click opens the link
- **photos render inline** — images ≤5MB auto-fetch over SSH (HEIC converted on the Mac); click opens full-size. PDFs/videos are chips — click fetches and opens them
- **send files** — Ctrl+V an image into the compose box, type `/attach <path>`, or drag-and-drop; a caption rides along
- select text and Ctrl+C · right-click a bubble to copy it whole
- compose box at the bottom, Enter sends — **DMs and groups**

**Toasts**
- desktop notification only for senders on your allowlist
- everything else still counts and still shows; it just doesn't interrupt you

**Toast actions**
- click a toast and the panel opens ON that conversation with the compose
  box focused (the Omarchy daemon renders no action buttons, so click IS
  the reply path)

**The app**
- double-click the bar icon, press `SUPER+M`, or IPC `app` for a
  Messages-style window (IPC `window` is a plain toggle). For the keybind, add
  this to `~/.config/hypr/bindings.lua` — it asks **Hyprland** where the
  window is (front → close, elsewhere → focus, none → create) instead of
  the plugin, because after an Omarchy plugin update the plugin's IPC can
  answer from a stale instance until the shell restarts:
  ```lua
  o.bind("SUPER + M", "Blip messages", [[sh -c '
    blip() { hyprctl clients -j | jq -r ".[] | select(.title | startswith(\"Blip\")) | .address" | head -1; }
    a=$(blip)
    if [ -z "$a" ]; then
      qs -p /usr/share/omarchy/shell ipc call nixfred.blip app >/dev/null
      for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12; do a=$(blip); [ -n "$a" ] && break; sleep 0.15; done
      [ -n "$a" ] && hyprctl dispatch "hl.dsp.focus({ window = \"address:$a\" })"
    elif [ "$(hyprctl activewindow -j | jq -r .address)" = "$a" ]; then
      hyprctl dispatch "hl.dsp.window.close({ window = \"address:$a\" })"
    else
      hyprctl dispatch "hl.dsp.focus({ window = \"address:$a\" })"
    fi']])
  ```
  sidebar of every conversation + the open thread + compose, tiled by
  Hyprland like any app, sharing the bar widget's live data; the title
  carries the unread count (`Blip (3)`)

**Real-time**
- a push watcher on the Mac pings when chat.db changes — messages land in
  ~2 s, the open conversation refreshes itself, and the poll drops to a
  60 s safety net (`status` shows `push=true`)

## Privacy

No server, no telemetry, no accounts. The full inventory of what touches
disk on both machines is in [docs/PRIVACY.md](docs/PRIVACY.md) — short
version: message text never lands on disk; only attachments you open are
cached. The threat model and the findings of the 2026-08-31 security audit
are in [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md).

## How it works

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/architecture.svg" alt="architecture" width="920">
</p>

```
Linux                                         Mac
─────                                         ───
BarWidget.qml  ── push/poll ──▶ collector.ts ──▶ ssh ──▶ imsg --json recent 150+
                                                          (sqlite, read-only)
BlipView.qml   ── open thread ─▶ thread.ts   ──▶ ssh ──▶ imsg --json thread <id> 80
BlipView.qml   ── Enter ─────(body on stdin)──▶ ssh ──▶ imsg-send --to <id> --yes --text-stdin
                                                          imsg-send --chat-id "any;+;<guid>" …
                                                          (AppleScript → Messages.app)
```

The trick that makes it possible: **`sshd` on macOS inherits both Full Disk
Access and Automation consent.** `cron` gets neither. So a plain SSH session can
read `chat.db` and tell Messages.app to send, where every scheduled approach
dies at a TCC prompt nobody is there to click.

With `ControlMaster` in `~/.ssh/config`, a round trip is ~47 ms warm. Fast
enough to poll, fast enough that the panel feels local.

## Install

Blip is **one source**: the Mac-side tools ride along in `bridge/mac/`
(vendored from [claude-on-mac](https://github.com/nixfred/claude-on-mac),
pinned in `bridge/BRIDGE-VERSION`), and `blip-setup` wires everything.

**Requirements**

- A Mac signed into Messages with your Apple ID (a Mac mini in a closet is
  perfect), reachable from the Linux box over SSH with key auth — Tailscale
  recommended. *Messages in iCloud* on, so its `chat.db` mirrors your phone.
- Linux: [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org) (Hyprland + the Omarchy shell), and on
  the box: `bun`, `jq`, `openssh`, `libnotify`, `wl-clipboard`, `xdg-utils`.
  `blip-setup` checks for each and prints the `pacman` line for what's missing.

> **Honest note on dependencies.** Blip is not a drop-in marketplace plugin
> the way a clock widget is: it needs `bun` on the Linux side, a Mac you own
> with two manual permission grants, and an ssh key between them. The
> plugin files install like any other; the *bridge* is what `blip-setup`
> exists for. Budget ten minutes and a trip to the Mac's System Settings.

**1. Install the plugin**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nixfred/blip ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/nixfred.blip
```

**2. Run the wizard** (idempotent — re-run any time)

```sh
~/.config/omarchy/plugins/nixfred.blip/scripts/blip-setup you@your-mac
```

It writes `~/.config/blip/bridge.conf`, adds an ssh ControlMaster block
(polling costs ~50 ms instead of a handshake), installs the bridge shim as
`~/bin/imsg`, `~/bin/imsg-send`, `~/bin/contacts`, copies the Mac tools to
`~/.blip/bin` on the Mac and runs `install.sh` there, generates a
**dedicated ssh key** (`~/.ssh/blip_ed25519`) that the Mac confines to the
five bridge tools and nothing else, then smoke-tests the bridge.

**3. Core grants on the Mac** (macOS won't let a script do these)

- *Full Disk Access* → add `/usr/libexec/sshd-keygen-wrapper` — that's what
  lets an ssh session read `chat.db`.
- *Automation → Messages* → the first send from ssh pops an Allow prompt on
  the Mac's screen; click it once.
- Optional contact comparison/linking: allow *Automation → Contacts*, then add
  `/usr/libexec/sshd-keygen-wrapper` under *Privacy & Security →
  Accessibility*. Contact writes still require both explicit Blip write gates.

`ssh your-mac python3 ~/.blip/bin/blip-check` tells you what's still missing
(the wizard runs it for you and waits while you click).

**4.** Add `{ "id": "nixfred.blip" }` to `bar.layout.right` in
`~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`, `omarchy-restart-shell`, and the speech
bubble is in your bar.

**Toasts**

```jsonc
// ~/.config/blip/allowlist.json — re-read every poll, no restart
{ "allow": ["+15551234567", "them@icloud.com"] }
```

## Settings and portable configuration

Choose the gear in Blip's message header to edit appearance live. The editor
writes a normal JSON file at `~/.config/blip/preferences.json`, so it can be
copied between machines or tracked by dotfile tooling. A restored file is
noticed within five seconds, or immediately with **Reload file**. Track the
real file rather than a symlink: the preference boundary deliberately refuses
symlinks and non-regular files.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "outgoingBubbleColor": "theme",
  "incomingBubbleColor": "theme",
  "backgroundOpacity": 0.7,
  "fontScale": 1,
  "density": 1,
  "sidebarWidth": 320,
  "avatarSize": 30,
  "cornerScale": 1
}
```

Bubble colors accept `"theme"`, `#rrggbb`, or `#rrggbbaa`. The GUI exposes
every field: app-window opacity, font scale, density, sidebar width, avatar
size, and corner roundness. Writes are atomic and owner-only; malformed,
oversized, symlinked, or out-of-range files are rejected with an error in the
settings view instead of being loaded into the long-lived shell.

Settings has separate **Contacts** and **Appearance** tabs, so identity repair
does not share one long scroll with visual preferences. The Contacts tab lists
direct conversations whose phone number or email resolves to more than one
Contacts name. Opening one replaces the list with a focused detail view; use
**All conversations** or Escape to return. Identity repair is deliberately
split into two stages. First, selecting a candidate changes nothing; a separate
**Save “Name” in Blip only** action writes the explicit display choice to
`~/.config/blip/identities.json`. It applies to pinned tiles, the thread list,
notifications, and sender labels. The file is portable and safe to restore
alongside `preferences.json`, but it contains personal names and handles, so
only put it in a private dotfiles repository.

Second, the optional Mac review stays collapsed until requested. It lists every
active matching source card separately, with large duplicate sets collapsed
again. Raw account databases sometimes retain historical cache rows that the
Contacts object layer no longer exposes; Blip verifies and omits those rows so
they cannot be mistaken for editable cards. **Compare & link N cards…** loads a
bounded, read-only view of each active card's discovered name, organization,
phone, email, address, URL, birthday, and notes, plus a de-duplicated combined
view and a short missing-details checklist. **Open & edit on Mac…** opens the
exact card when a source value needs completing.

From that comparison Blip can ask Contacts to select the exact cards and report
Apple's currently enabled **Link Selected Cards** or **Merge Selected Cards**
action. Nothing happens until a second confirmation names that exact action.
The action is pinned through the SSH bridge and refused if it changes before
the click. It changes Contacts and may sync upstream; unlike the narrow
phone/email repair below, Blip cannot provide an automatic unlink receipt.
This handoff needs Automation → Contacts and Accessibility for
`/usr/libexec/sshd-keygen-wrapper` on the Mac.

For a handle attached to the wrong person, Blip can also inspect the exact
card, show a destructive confirmation, remove only that verified phone/email
through Contacts.app, and offer an immediate undo; its private receipt expires
after seven days. Both write features require `contact_writes=on` plus the
separate owner-only Mac gate. Blip never writes the private Contacts SQLite
database or deletes a possibly shared number without confirmation. A custom
Blip-only name is available when no source card exists.

## Keyboard

| where | key | does |
|---|---|---|
| list | `j` / `k` · `↑` / `↓` | move |
| list | `Enter` · `1`–`9` | open thread |
| list | `r` | refresh |
| list | `a` · *mark all read* link | clear every badge and dot (local only — iMessage itself is not told) |
| list | `/` | search every message ever — Enter runs it, click a hit to open its conversation, Esc backs out |
| list | `n` · *＋ new* link | start a conversation with anyone — search contacts by name, or type a number/email directly |
| thread | `Enter` | send (text, or the queued file with the text as caption) |
| thread | `Ctrl+V` | paste — an image on the clipboard becomes a queued file, text pastes normally |
| thread | `/attach <path>` + `Enter` | queue any file on this machine; drag-and-drop works too |
| thread | `Esc` | back to list (or clear a text selection first) |
| anywhere | `Esc` | close |

IPC, for scripts and other plugins:

```sh
qs -p /usr/share/omarchy/shell ipc call nixfred.blip status
qs -p /usr/share/omarchy/shell ipc call nixfred.blip settings
qs -p /usr/share/omarchy/shell ipc call nixfred.blip goto 15551234567   # bare digits
qs -p /usr/share/omarchy/shell ipc call nixfred.blip read               # mark all read
```

Everything that sends or reads message content over IPC (`goto`, `compose`,
`bubbles`, `threads`, `find`, `newchat`, `read`) is **off by default** — any
local process could otherwise send as you. Turn it on with `automation=on`
in `~/.config/blip/bridge.conf` (re-read live). `status`, `open`, `close`,
`toggle`, `window`, `app`, `settings` are always available.

## Design notes worth knowing

**Two read marks, not one.** The collector keeps `watermark` (highest timestamp
it has *seen* — drives toasts) separate from `readMark` and per-thread
`readMarks` (highest timestamp *you* have looked at — drives the badge and the
dots). Fold them together and the badge flashes to 1 and resets on the next
poll. Yes, that shipped once.

**Unread is a ledger, not a window.** The latest 150 rows are enough for normal
previews, but unread counts and oldest-unread timestamps live in a metadata-only
per-chat ledger. Blip expands the fetch to cover new arrivals and the oldest
outstanding unread, then rebuilds exact counts from that range. An unread cannot
fall off the preview window or remain counted after deletion.

**Groups send by GUID.** Message rows carry a group as a bare
`chat_identifier` (32 hex, or `chat<digits>`); AppleScript's `chat id` wants
the full `any;+;<id>`. A group's `handle` field is whichever member spoke last
— send to *that* and you DM one person while the panel shows the group.
`imsg groups` supplies the real GUID; a group whose GUID isn't cached yet is
read-only rather than guessed.

**The self-thread lies.** A message you send yourself lands twice: once
`from_me=true`, once `from_me=false`, same timestamp and text. Every counter and
every bubble runs through `dedupeSelfEcho()` first or your own notes light the
badge forever.

**Deleted means deleted.** macOS keeps deleted messages in a 30-day "Recently
Deleted" bin that is still in `chat.db`. claude-on-mac's `imsg` hides those rows, so
a conversation you delete on the phone disappears from Blip within one poll of
the iCloud sync. `IMSG_INCLUDE_DELETED=1` shows them again.

**No message bodies are stored on Linux.** `~/.local/state/blip/state.json`
holds timestamps, unread counts, SHA-256 toast-dedupe keys, inferred self-chat
ids, and group metadata. It is written atomically with mode `0600`; legacy
plaintext toast keys are hashed on migration. No message text is persisted.
The 273,000-message history stays on the Mac where it lives.

## What it can't do

- **Send read receipts.** Tested: opening the conversation on the Mac via
  `open imessage://…` does not flip `is_read`. Needs Apple's private API.
  (Showing *their* receipts on your messages works fine — that's in.)
- **Send tapbacks, edits, or threaded replies.** AppleScript can't; Blip
  *displays* all three. If you need to send them,
  [BlueBubbles](https://bluebubbles.app) is the right tool and requires
  disabling SIP.
- **Work without a Mac, or while the Mac sleeps.** Inherent to the approach.
  The widget dims and tells you.

## Development

```sh
bun test                                     # 217 tests, ~125 ms
bun collector.ts --deep | jq '.unread, (.threads|length)'
bun thread.ts +15551234567 40 | jq '.bubbles[-1]'
```

Logic lives in TypeScript where it can be tested; QML only renders. Every
layout bug so far was found with `grim` and eyeballs, not by reading code —
screenshot your changes. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the invariants.
